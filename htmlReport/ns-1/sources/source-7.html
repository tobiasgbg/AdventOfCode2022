&nbsp;--- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ---
&nbsp;The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. &quot;The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--&quot; Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone&#39;s tent.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Since you can&#39;t be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;A Y
&nbsp;B X
&nbsp;C Z
&nbsp;This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).
&nbsp;In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
&nbsp;The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.
&nbsp;In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).
&nbsp;
&nbsp;What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?
